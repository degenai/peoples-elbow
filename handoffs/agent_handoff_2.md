# Agent Handoff Notes - People's Elbow Site Enhancements (Session 2)

## User Objective:
Prepare "The People's Elbow" website for an upcoming event. This involved:
1.  Hiding the "Dev Ring" (changelog/version history) to present a cleaner, more polished site to new visitors.
2.  Enhancing the main page with engaging content and branding that reflects the site's values, focusing on the "Convention of Tension Prevention" theme.

## Key Changes Implemented (This Session):

### Branding and Content Updates (index.html, css/main.css):
*   **Dev Ring Hidden**: The link/badge for the dev ring was commented out in `index.html`.
*   **Hero Section Enhanced**:
    *   Added a new subtitle: "Fighting the Forces of Tension, one elbow at a time!"
    *   New CSS class `hero-subtitle` created and styled (gold color, text shadow).
*   **"Convention of Tension Prevention" Theme**:
    *   Host connection section rebranded to "Join the Convention of Tension Prevention."
    *   Mission statement updated to incorporate the "Convention" narrative and fight against "Forces of Tension."
    *   Primary Call to Action (CTA) changed from "Host an Event" to "Join the Convention."
*   **CSS Variable**: Added `--pe-green-dark: #004225;` to `css/main.css` for use in gradients.

### Visual Polish & "Coming Soon" Placeholders:
*   **Impact Counters (index.html, css/main.css, js/main.js)**:
    *   Initial idea: Animated numbers.
    *   Refinement 1: Changed to animated "?" symbols with pulsing effect.
    *   Refinement 2: Animations toned down (limited iterations instead of infinite).
    *   Refinement 3: Replaced "?" with static "TBD" text.
    *   Bug Fix (js/main.js): Modified `animateStats` function to prevent JavaScript from trying to animate "TBD" values, which caused numbers to reappear. The check `if (target.textContent.trim() === 'TBD')` was added.
    *   CSS for `coming-soon-number` updated to style "TBD" appropriately (smaller font `2rem`, no pulse animation, `font-weight: bold`, `opacity: 0.8`).
*   **Map Placeholder (index.html, css/main.css)**:
    *   Enhanced with a gradient background (`linear-gradient(135deg, var(--pe-green) 0%, var(--pe-green-dark) 100%)`).
    *   Subtle rotating radial gradient overlay (animation `rotate 20s linear 1` - runs once).
    *   Bouncing map icon (`<i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i>`) animation (`bounce 2s ease-in-out 3` - runs 3 times).
    *   Text updated to "Convention territories coming soon!"
*   **Tension Meter (Initially added, then removed)**:
    *   A "Community Tension Level" meter graphic was added to the mission section (`<div class="mission-graphic">`).
    *   This feature was later removed from both `index.html` and `css/main.css` at the user's request to simplify.

## Design Decisions & User Intent (This Session):
*   The primary goal was to make the site look polished and thematic for new visitors at an event.
*   The "Convention of Tension Prevention" and "Forces of Tension" narrative is key to the site's playful and approachable branding.
*   Animations were desired for "pop" but needed to be subtle and not overly distracting. Infinite animations were explicitly changed to limited runs or removed entirely.
*   Placeholders for future content (like impact stats and map locations) should be clear ("TBD", "Coming Soon") and build anticipation without being misleading.
*   Static placeholders are preferred over animated ones if the animation causes issues or is too distracting (e.g., impact counters).

## Current State (End of This Session):
*   The site is ready for the event.
*   Dev Ring is hidden.
*   Main page reflects the "Convention of Tension Prevention" theme.
*   Impact counters display "TBD" statically and correctly (no JS animation bug).
*   Map placeholder has subtle, limited animations.
*   The codebase reflects these changes in `index.html`, `css/main.css`, and `js/main.js`.
