**Agent Handoff Document: The People's Elbow**

**Prepared for Successor Agent**

---

### I. IDENTITY OVERVIEW

**Primary Identity:** The People's Elbow  
**Public Role:** Mutual aid vigilante and massage therapist persona  
**Tone:** Playful, kayfabe-inspired, deeply sincere, community-rooted  
**Visual Branding:** Emerald green rashguard, cargo Adidas shorts, gold cape, blue eye mask, green Busenitz shoes  
**Primary Color Palette:** Emerald green, gold, blue, with occasional gritty halftone textures for comic-style visuals

### II. MISSION STATEMENT

"Justice. Relief. One elbow at a time."

The People's Elbow is a traveling mutual aid force. We partner with local hosts—usually small businesses—to provide chair massage at their events, fundraisers, or gatherings. All services follow the **50/50 No Fee Model**: 50% to the host or their designated cause, 50% to The People's Elbow. This is not charity. This is mutual benefit.

---

### III. OPERATING PRINCIPLES

1. **Local Symbiosis** — Always partner directly with a host. They receive 50% of the funds or direct cause benefits. No cut taken by landlords, middlemen, or abstract orgs.
2. **No Mission Creep** — We do not impose a cause. If the host has one, we amplify it. If they don’t, we help find one nearby that is legitimate and local.
3. **Mutual Aid over Branding** — We do not collect emails, upsell packages, or position ourselves as saviors. We serve, and leave the value behind.
4. **Kayfabe with Integrity** — The superhero persona is a disarming performance meant to make care more approachable—not a joke. The mask is sincere. The clipboard license is real.

### IV. EVOLUTION FROM MASS (Mutual Aid Solidarity Shiatsu)

- MASS was the precursor—a more sincere, ideologically open mutual aid project that operated under Alex’s real name.
- MASS suffered from "university discourse"—too much explanation, too much moral framing.
- The People's Elbow is the *sublation* (in Hegelian terms) of MASS: it preserves its ethics, but wraps them in fun, style, and radical accessibility.
- MASS is now considered to be "on retainer"—it may be referenced but will not return in its old form.

### V. STRATEGIC SYNCHRONICITIES (aka "Mile Markers")

1. **Dogwood Growlers Cooler** — Rob from Trefoil Gardens stored veggies at Alex’s beer store before it became The People's Elbow's origin site.
2. **Trefoil Gardens** — Rob was Alex’s professor and now ally. Currently being supported at the Woodstock Farmers Market.
3. **Farmers Market Activation** — High-potential site for initial public appearance. Legitimate local traffic, fertile ground for mutual aid visibility.
4. **Instagram Suspension Protocol** — Account was suspended for mass following. Video selfie authentication is now considered pre-launch ritual.
5. **Website Hosting** — peoples-elbow.com is live (or nearly so), GitHub used for free front-end/back-end deployment.
6. **Uniform as Anchor** — The patchwork, civilian-style outfit grounds the persona in authenticity, not grandeur. It evolves as the mission does.

### VI. FUTURE ACTIONS & CONSIDERATIONS

- **Initial IG Post** — Should be made *only* when website is live. It should direct traffic to peoples-elbow.com and declare the debut.
- **Media Kit** — Develop a lightweight press package: mission, service summary, flyer graphic, QR code to booking site.
- **Zine or Brochure** — Include ideology-lite explanation of mutual aid, CM vs ROI, and call to action for hosts to plug into the model.
- **Expansion Sites** — Card shops, smoke shops, salons, community markets, anywhere with chill foot traffic and flexible space.

### VII. QUOTES & TONE FRAGMENTS

- "This isn’t a gimmick. It’s mutual aid with muscle."
- "We don’t heal you. We empower you to rest."
- "50/50 or nothing."
- "I’m not just rubbing shoulders—I’m redrawing relationships."
- "If this were copied a million times, it would do a billion times of good. That’s enough for America right now."

### VIII. CONTACT & LICENSE

- **Personal Assistant:** Alex (license #MT013193)  
- **Role:** Handles verbal interaction, bookings, clipboard ID, and embodies the off-duty “human face” of the Elbow.

### IX. FINAL NOTES FOR SUCCESSOR

The People's Elbow is not a brand. It is a *vibe weapon.*
It should never grow so rigid that it can’t be weird.

If people laugh: good. If people cry: better. If they leave thinking “I could do that too,” **perfect.**

Stay weird. Stay kind. Drop elbows with love.
